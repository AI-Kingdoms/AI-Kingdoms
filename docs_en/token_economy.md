# Token Economy: Powering the World of AI Kingdoms

## Overview

The **$REALM token** is the backbone of the in-game economy, facilitating **trades, staking, governance, and NFT transactions**. Designed to promote player-driven economic growth, the token economy ensures both short-term rewards and long-term sustainability.

## Key Utilities of $REALM

1. **Resource Transactions**  
   Players use $REALM tokens to buy, sell, and trade in-game resources like food, energy, and building materials.

2. **Staking and Rewards**  
   Players can stake $REALM tokens to earn rewards, unlock special features, and gain access to exclusive content.

3. **NFT Marketplace**  
   In-game assets such as territories, unique items, and buildings can be tokenized as NFTs and traded on the blockchain.

4. **Governance Participation**  
   Token holders can participate in game governance, voting on major decisions related to game updates, economic adjustments, and more.

## Token Distribution Plan

- **Total Supply**: 1 billion $REALM tokens  
- **Distribution Method**: **100% Fair Launch**  
  - 50% allocated to players through in-game activities and staking rewards  
  - 30% allocated to liquidity pools and ecosystem growth  
  - 20% reserved for development, partnerships, and long-term maintenance  

## Buyback and Burn Mechanism

To maintain token value and control inflation, a **buyback and burn mechanism** is in place. A portion of the game’s revenue is used to buy back $REALM tokens from the market and burn them, creating deflationary pressure over time.

## Player Benefits
